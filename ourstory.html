            <h1> THE FARM-TO-PLATE STORY</h1>
            <p>Your herbs start their life as a little seed on broad acre farms in Queensland and Victoria. The herbs
                are cared for, fed and grown organically by our dedicated group of farmers who are truly passionate
                about producing fresh herbs that are brimming with essential oils, which is the key to unlocking the
                flavor, aroma and color of herbs. Years of research and work has been invested into finding the optimum
                conditions and care for each variety of herb.</p>

            <h1> OUR HISTORY</h1>
            <p>Two Australian scientists (and brothers) frustrated with the short life of culinary herbs develop the
                ‘Eva Fresh’ technology which extends the shelf life of fresh herbs, without the need of cooking or
                heating. The technology is eventually bought by Berri, a fruit juice manufacturer.</p>

            <h1>SUSTAINABILITY</h1>
            <p>Consideration for the environment has been very important to Gourmet Garden and this is reflected in the
                design of the company’s headquarter building built in 2006, which houses the factory, laboratories and
                offices.</p>
